# btmbtm's Extra GRE Reading Comp Guide


## Intro 

### Pre

This guide is just a collection of notes I wrote and compiled that helped me demistify GRE reading comprehension. It is not the holy grail of GRE reading guides (no guide is) nor does it have any EARTH SHATTERING RC SECRETS, but it does offer some interesting thoughts on and good strategies for GRE RC. I recommend using this guide in conjunction with other GRE guides to play with tactics and build your own GRE RC strategy. See below for some suggestions(note that some guides pertain to other exams, but are still relevant for GRE RC):

MUST BUY OFFICIAL PRACTICE MATERIAL:

- [Official GRE Verbal Reasoning Practice Questions](http://amzn.to/2aoCQjt) (gives most GRE like questions as it was created by ETS/great way to get a feel of REAL GRE passage)

### Your Background 

This guide assumes you already know the basics of GRE reading comprehension, have read a basic guide on the GRE verbal section, understand the general structure of a GRE RC passage, and know basic question types.

### My Background 

- Scores: 170 V 168 Q 
- Native English speaker
- Non-verbal major

### What this Guide Will Cover

- Overlooked Prereqs for Acing RC
- A Better Reading Process for RC
- Attacking, Understanding, and Breakingdown RC Questions and Answer Choices
- How to Practice for GRE RC
- How to Get Unstuck 
- Other GRE Guides



## Overlooked Prereqs for Acing RC

### Mastery of GRE Vocab Gives You More Time for Reading Comp Passages

While practicing for GRE, you must also brute force the top ~500-1000 core GRE vocab words in order to dominate text completion and sentence equivalence questions. By answering TC and SE questions quickly(30-60 seconds per question), you give yourself precious extra time to conquer harder reading passages that usually take up a solid chunk of a verbal section's time.

The following are solid vocab tools/lists that will help you conquer the requisite vocab: 
  
- Websites/Apps: 
  
  - [Magoosh's GRE Vocab App/Web App](https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary)(FREE)
    
- Physical Flashcards: 
  
  - Manhattan GRE Flashcards (should use both sets)
    - [500 Essential Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards](http://amzn.to/2aed2n1)
    - [500 Advanced Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards](http://amzn.to/2amYkzJ)
    
- Books

  - [Barron's Essential Words for the GRE](http://amzn.to/2animnM)
  - [Princeton Review's Word Smart for the GRE](http://amzn.to/2aedwtA)
  - [GRE Vocab Capacity: 2016 Edition](http://amzn.to/2anhVKk)(Filled w/ memory tricks and mnemonics) 

I would recommend picking two resources that match your learning style from the above and mastering all the words within them. When learning make sure to learn the words in context via sentences to master usage, not via vague synonym pairs or generic word groups.  You should be doing this vocab work daily in conjuction to your other GRE studying.


## A Better Reading Process for RC

### Frame of Mind

  Sympathy with the author.
  
### Reading Process

The basic reading process I recommend only has three steps and is as follows: 

1. Read thoroughly using your natural reading techniques to get the gist of a passage

    You should read thru the passage using your normal reading speed/methods. There is no need to learn speed reading nor change how you normally read (changing your reading habits would probably harm your GRE scores). 
    
    Also, remember the goal of reading a passage  isn't to memorize details nor recite the passge from memory, but just read through the passage to get a general sense of the passage structure and an idea of where the author stands. 

2. Reread complex sentences

    If you run into a tricky sentence reread once or twice trying to glean as much as possible and than move on with as much understanding as possible. We don't want to get bogged down in the details. Paraphrase a lot. The sentence may not even be relevant to any questions, and if it is we can always reread it. 

3. Summarize/recap via skimming

    Summarize/recap via skimming after reading the text is the most vital step to acing GRE questions as it gives us a strong mental framework of the passage before jumping into the questions. I recommend summarizing while skimming instead other techniques like pausing and mentally summarizing, or other techniques that are passive and reliant on faulty human memory. Skimming + summarizing is best because it is active so you can stay engaged and because it builds a summary on the actual text, not memeory. The actual process is as follows: 

    1. Start from the first paragraph and jump from line to line looking for any key words
    2. While doing this summarize mentally with your inner voice: 'Paragraph 1 says a, b, c' 
    3. Don't get caught up on all the details, keep forging ahead
      
    After your skim/summary you should be able to answer any main idea questions.

### Other thoughts 

1. Reading speed < Comprehension

    I've seen many suggest taking speed reading courses or using an app to improve reading speed. The truth is that reading speed isn't that important, especially at the cost of comprehension as comprehension is king on standardized tests. Anything that harms your comprehension is costing you points. As long as you can read at the speed of a normal college grad, you should have enough time on the exam to go through each RC passage comfortably. However, if you do read abysmally slow and can't finish sections due to this, look into some methods to get you to normal reading speed with high comprehension or check for any learning disabilities that are slowing your reading speed down. 
  
1. Note taking
  
    Since the GRE is a computer test in the USA, I'd recommend against note taking as you can't directly markup the passage. When taking notes you take your eye off the passage and computer screen which is potentially dangerous as this sort of context switching from notebook to computer screen is taxing on the memory and kills concentration. The only time I'd suggest note taking is if your mind wanders easily and note taking would keep you focused. Even in that case I would recommend taking notes without looking down at your paper and not refer to them when doing questions.

## Attacking, Understanding, and Breakingdown Questions and Answer Choices

### Process Overview

  1. Read questions
  2. Find relevant section and reread details quickly
  3. Go thru answers
    1. Quickly eliminate wrong answers
    2. Jump back into text to find concrete support for right answer

### The answer is in the text

### Learn to ID Wrong Answer Choices

  1. Extreme
  2. Categorical 
  2. Rotten Detail
  3. True but Irrelevant
  4. Out of scope
  5. Distortion
  6. Judgement
  7. Assumption
  
### Tackling Inference Questions 

### Other thoughts on Answering Questions

  Spend most of your time in the text
  > I hate writing explanations for LSAT reading comprehension. It’s the most boring section by far. The answers don’t require thought. They just require line references. “C is wrong because line 32 says….” “Line 47 directly says D”, etc. There’s none of the logical subtleties of LR, or the chains of reasoning from LG. In reading comprehension, you can prove or disprove most answers merely by pointing to a line.
  
## Getting Unstuck!

1. Reread!
2. Skip and comeback
3. Deep Reset

## How to Practice

- Blind practice
- Blind questions (answer q's w/o looking at passage)
- Prove/Disprove Answer Choices (prove right answer and disprove wrong answers w/ category)
- Take summary after passage and only use notes
- Memory Method

Reading Comprehension line references answer everything

Reading comprehension is by far the dullest section to explain. By far. Have a look at some sample explanations. These answers are from a couple questions in PT 70, passages 2 and 3. (Don’t worry, they won’t spoil anything if you haven’t done the tests).

Look at the line references:

Question 10

A. Lines 19–23 indicate that social scientists largely ignored dance. So the ‘peers’ wouldn’t have had an opinion on whether dance was interpreted correctly or incorrectly.

B. Lines 26–27 explain why dance experts didn’t study dance ethnology. It was because they weren’t trained in social science. It had nothing to do with being preoccupied.

Question 23

B. Lines 33–42 indicate that people would call skydiving voluntary in order to avoid spending money to make it safer.

D. CORRECT. Lines 25–27 say this directly.

Except for main point questions, most of my reading comprehension explanations read like this. If you find the right line, you can prove or disprove every answer. Most wrong answers use the following simple tricks:

They mention something out of context
They mention something that was never mentioned in the passage, but feels on topic
They combine two unrelated concepts that appeared in the passage
If you know what’s going on in the passage, and if you know the right section to check if something was mentioned, you can avoid choosing wrong answers.

Now, I know what you’re thinking. You say that you know the answers are in the passage, but you don’t have time. Ah, time, we never have enough.

Well, the students who score perfect on RC have enough time to check. I’d say they have enough time because they check. It’s so easy to overestimate how much time it takes to look back to the passage, and to underestimate how much time you waste staring blankly at the answers. I do teach people to read faster, but most students who score perfectly on reading comprehension read at an average speed or only slightly faster, and they have exactly as much time as you do!

Most students can learn to refer back to the passage in 1–2 seconds. This isn’t hard. If you do the upfront work of understanding the passage’s meaning and organization, you can know where facts would be mentioned. Once you know where facts are, don’t stare at answers and “think”. Thinking is not how you prove answers. You prove answers by looking back to the passage, saying “ah yes, it says it right here, line 32”, and swiftly choosing the right answer with 100% confidence. You can’t “think” your way to proving an answer. Thinking is not your friend. Only the passage can prove answers.
