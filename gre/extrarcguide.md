# btmbtm's Extra GRE Reading Comp Guide


## Intro 

### Pre

This guide is just a collection of notes I compiled that helped me demistify GRE reading comprehension. It is not the holy grail of GRE reading guides (no guide is) nor does it have any EARTH SHATTERING RC SECRETS, but it does offer some interesting thoughts on and good strategies for GRE RC. I recommend using this guide in conjunction with other GRE guides to play with ideas and build your own GRE RC strategy. See below for some suggestions(note that some guides pertain to other exams, but are still relevant for GRE RC):

MUST BUY OFFICIAL PRACTICE MATERIAL:

- [Official GRE Verbal Reasoning Practice Questions](http://amzn.to/2aoCQjt) (This book gives the most GRE like questions as it was created by ETS! It is also the best way to get a feel of the real test.)

Online Guides: 

- [The Ultimate Guide to Destroy GRE Reading Comprehension](https://crunchprep.com/gre-reading-comprehension-guide)
- [Guide To LSAT Reading Comprehension by graeme_b](https://www.reddit.com/r/LSAT/comments/ud0rw/guide_to_lsat_reading_comprehension/)

GRE RC Guides Books: 

- [Manhattan GRE's Reading Comprehension & Essays Book](http://amzn.to/2asoLz3)
- [LSAT Reading Comprehension - The Ultimate Improvement Guide](http://amzn.to/2aFIzCg)

### Your Background 

This guide assumes you already know the basics of GRE reading comprehension, have read a basic guide on the GRE verbal section, and understand the general structure of a GRE RC passage and basic question types.

### My Background 

- Major: something STEMy
- Scores: 170 V 168 Q 
- Native English speaker

### What this Guide Will Cover

- Overlooked Prereqs for Acing RC
- A Better Reading Process for RC
- Attacking, Understanding, and Breakingdown RC Questions and Answer Choices
- How to Practice for GRE RC
- How to Get Unstuck 
- Other GRE Guides



## Overlooked Prereqs for Acing RC

### Mastery of GRE Vocab Gives You More Time for Reading Comp Passages

While practicing for RC, you must also brute force the top ~500-1000 core GRE vocab words so you can dominate text completion and sentence equivalence questions. By answering TC and SE questions quickly(30-60 seconds per question), you give yourself precious extra time to conquer harder reading passages that usually take up a solid chunk of a verbal section's time.

The following are solid vocab tools/lists that will help you conquer the requisite vocab: 
  
- Websites/Apps: 
  
  - [Magoosh's GRE Vocab App/Web App](https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary)(FREE)
    
- Physical Flashcards: 
  
  - Manhattan GRE Flashcards (should use both sets)
    - [500 Essential Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards](http://amzn.to/2aed2n1)
    - [500 Advanced Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards](http://amzn.to/2amYkzJ)
    
- Books

  - [Barron's Essential Words for the GRE](http://amzn.to/2animnM)
  - [Princeton Review's Word Smart for the GRE](http://amzn.to/2aedwtA)
  - [GRE Vocab Capacity: 2016 Edition](http://amzn.to/2anhVKk)(Filled w/ memory tricks and mnemonics) 

I would recommend picking two resources from the above and mastering all the words within them. You should be doing vocab work daily in conjuction to your other GRE studying. When learning make sure to learn the words in context via sentences to master usage, not via vague synonym pairs or generic word groups.


## A Better Reading Process for RC

### Frame of Mind

  Sympathy with the author.
  
### Reading Process

The basic reading process I recommend only has three steps and is as follows: 

1. Read thoroughly using your natural reading techniques to get the gist of a passage

    You should read thru the passage using your normal reading speed/methods. There is no need to learn speed reading nor change how you normally read (changing your reading habits would probably harm your GRE scores). 
    
    Also, remember the goal of reading a passage  isn't to memorize details nor recite the passge from memory, but just read through the passage to get a general sense of the passage structure and an idea of where the author stands. 

2. Reread complex sentences

    If you run into a tricky sentence reread once or twice trying to glean as much as possible and than move on with as much understanding as possible. We don't want to get bogged down in the details. Paraphrase a lot. The sentence may not even be relevant to any questions, and if it is we can always reread it. 

3. Summarize/recap via skimming

    This is the most vital step to acing GRE questions as it gives us a strong overview of the passage before jumping into the questions. I recommend summarizing while skimming instead other techniques like pausing and mentally summarizing or other techniques which are passive and reliant on faulty human memory. Skimming + summarizing is because it is active and is based on the actual text, not memeory. So how to do this: 

    1. Start from the first paragraph and jump from line to line looking for any key words
    2. While doing this summarize mentally with your inner voice: 'Paragraph 1 says a, b, c' 
    3. Don't get caught up on all the details, keep forging ahead
      
    After your skim/summary you should be able to answer any main idea questions.

### Other thoughts 
1. Reading speed < Comprehension

    I've seen many suggest taking speed reading courses or using an app to improve reading speed. The truth is that reading speed isn't that important, especially at the cost of comprehension as comprehension is king on standardized tests. Anything that harms your comprehension is costing you points. As long as you can read at the speed of a normal college grad, you should have enough time on the exam to go through each RC passage comfortably. 
    
    However, if you read abysmally slow, look into some methods to get you to normal reading speed with high comprehension. 
  
1. Note taking
  
    Since the GRE is a computer test in the USA, I'd recommend against note taking as you can't directly markup the passage. When taking notes you take your eye off the passage and computer screen which is potentially dangerous as this sort of context switching from notebook to computer screen is taxing on the memory and kills concentration. The only time I'd suggest note taking is if your mind wanders easily and note taking would keep you focused. Even in that case I would recommend taking notes without looking down at your paper. 

## Attacking, Understanding, and Breakingdown Questions and Answer Choices

### Process Overview

  1. Read questions
  2. Find relevant section and reread details quickly
  3. Go thru answers
    1. Quickly eliminate wrong answers
    2. Jump back into text to find concrete support for right answer

### Learn to ID Wrong Answer Choices

  1. Extreme
  2. Categorical 
  2. Rotten Detail
  3. True but Irrelevant
  4. Out of scope
  5. Distortion
  6. Judgement
  7. Assumption
