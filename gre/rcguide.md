## my background 

scores: 170 V 168 Q 

## RC Pre-reqs 

- Mastery of GRE vocab
  
  You must brute force the top ~500 vocab words and dominate sentence completion questions. By answering sentence completion questions quickly(30-60 seconds per question), you give yourself enough time to dive into reading passages.

- Good mental/physical habits/health
  
  You need to have a good sleep hygine and a healthy diet to max out your RC scores. If your mind and body are generally sluggish due to poor sleep and diet, how can you expect to score highly on the GRE? 

  You also have to go into the test with a positive frame of mind and detach yourself from the outcome of the test. Panicking/anxiety will just lower your scores. 

DO: 
  - Master GRE vocabulary
  - Sleep/eat well
  - Have a positive mindset
