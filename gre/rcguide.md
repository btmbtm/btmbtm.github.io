### Mastery of GRE vocab

While practicing for RC, you must also brute force the top ~500-1000 core GRE vocab words and dominate sentence completion questions. By answering sentence completion questions quickly(30-60 seconds per question), you give yourself extra precious time to dive into reading passages.

The following are solid vocab tools/lists: 
  
- Websites/Apps: 
  
  - [Magoosh's GRE Vocab App/Web App](https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary)
    
- Physical Flashcards: 
  
  - Manhattan GRE Flashcards (should use both sets)
    - [500 Essential Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards](http://amzn.to/2aed2n1)
    - [500 Advanced Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards](http://amzn.to/2amYkzJ)
    
- Books

  - [Barron's Essential Words for the GRE](http://amzn.to/2animnM)
  - [Princeton Review's Word Smart for the GRE](http://amzn.to/2aedwtA)
  - [GRE Vocab Capacity: 2016 Edition](http://amzn.to/2anhVKk)(Filled w/ memory tricks and mnemonics) 

I would recommend picking two resources from the above and mastering all the words within them. You should be doing vocab work daily. When learning make sure to learn the words in context via sentences, not via vague synonym pairs or generic word groups.

### Good mental/physical health
  
  You need to have a good sleep hygine and a healthy diet to max out your RC scores. If your mind and body are generally sluggish due to poor sleep and diet, how can you expect to score highly on the GRE? 

  You also have to go into the test with a positive frame of mind and detach yourself from the outcome of the test. Panicking/anxiety will just lower your scores.
