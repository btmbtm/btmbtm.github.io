## Intro 

### Your Background 

This guide assumes you already know the basics of GRE reading comprehension, have read a basic guide on the GRE verbal section, and understand the general structure of a GRE RC passage and basic question types. 

### My Background 

- Major: something STEM
- Scores: 170 V 168 Q 

### What this Guide Will Cover

- Overlooked Prereqs to Acing RC
- A Better Reading Process for RC
- Attacking, Understanding, and Breakingdown RC Questions and Answer Choices
- How to Practice for GRE RC
- How to Get Unstuck 

## Overlooked Prereqs to Acing RC

### Mastery of GRE vocab

While practicing for RC, you must also brute force the top ~500-1000 core GRE vocab words and dominate sentence completion questions. By answering sentence completion questions quickly(30-60 seconds per question), you give yourself precious extra time to conquer harder reading passages that usually take up a solid chunk of a verbal section's time.

The following are solid vocab tools/lists: 
  
- Websites/Apps: 
  
  - [Magoosh's GRE Vocab App/Web App](https://gre.magoosh.com/flashcards/vocabulary)
    
- Physical Flashcards: 
  
  - Manhattan GRE Flashcards (should use both sets)
    - [500 Essential Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards](http://amzn.to/2aed2n1)
    - [500 Advanced Words: GRE Vocabulary Flash Cards](http://amzn.to/2amYkzJ)
    
- Books

  - [Barron's Essential Words for the GRE](http://amzn.to/2animnM)
  - [Princeton Review's Word Smart for the GRE](http://amzn.to/2aedwtA)
  - [GRE Vocab Capacity: 2016 Edition](http://amzn.to/2anhVKk)(Filled w/ memory tricks and mnemonics) 

I would recommend picking two resources from the above and mastering all the words within them. You should be doing vocab work daily in conjuction to your other GRE studying. When learning make sure to learn the words in context via sentences, not via vague synonym pairs or generic word groups.


## A Better Reading Process for RC

### Frame of Mind

  Sympathy with the author.
  
### Reading Process
1. Read thoroughly using your natural reading techniques to get the gist of a passage

    You should read thru the passage using your normal reading speed/methods. There is no need to learn speed reading nor change how you normally read (changing your reading habits would probably harm your GRE scores). 
    
    Also, remember the goal of reading a passage  isn't to memorize details nor recite the passge from memory, but just read through the passage to get a general sense of the passage structure and an idea of where the author stands. 

2. Reread complex sentences

    If you run into a tricky sentence reread once or twice trying to glean as much as possible and than move on with as much understanding as possible. We don't want to get bogged down in the details. Paraphrase a lot. The sentence may not even be relevant to any questions, and if it is we can always reread it. 

3. Summarize/recap via skimming

    This is the most vital step to acing GRE questions as it gives us a strong overview of the passage before jumping into the questions. I recommend summarizing while skimming instead other techniques like pausing or using a mental image because it is active and doesn't depend on faulty human memory. So how to do this: 

    1. Start from the first paragraph and jump from line to line looking for any key words
    2. While doing this summarize mentally with your inner voice: 'Paragraph 1 says a, b, c' 
    3. Don't get caught up on all the details, keep forging ahead
      
    After your skim/summary you should be able to answer any main idea questions. 


### Other thoughts 

1. Note taking
  
  Since the GRE is a computer test in the USA, I'd recommend against note taking as you can't directly markup the passage. When taking notes you take your eye off the passage and computer screen which is potentially dangerous as this sort of context switching from notebook to computer screen is taxing on the memory and kills concentration. The only time I'd suggest note taking is if your mind wanders easily and note taking would keep you focused. Even in that case I would recommend taking notes without looking down at your paper. 

## Attacking, Understanding, and Breakingdown Questions and Answer Choices
