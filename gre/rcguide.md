scores: 170 V 168 Q 

## RC Pre-reqs 

- Mastery of GRE vocab
  You must brute force the top ~500 vocab words and dominate sentence completion questions. Doing this is vital for a few reasons: 
    1. By answering sentence completion questions quickly, you give yourself enough time to dive into reading passages
    2. Gives you confidence you will still score high
- Good mental/physical habits/health
  You need to have a good sleep hygine and a healthy diet to max out your RC scores. You also have to go into the test with a positive frame of mind and detach yourself from the outcome of the test. Panicking/anxiety will just lower your scores.
